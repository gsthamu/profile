## How I Built It

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design patterns
  - Glassmorphism effects for depth
  - Gradient accents for visual interest
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Fully responsive mobile-first design
- **Deployment**: Docker + Nginx + Google Cloud Run
- **Development**: Built with Google Antigravity AI assistant

### Design Decisions

**Modern Dark Theme**: I chose a dark theme with vibrant gradient accents (purples, blues, teals) to create a tech-forward aesthetic that stands out while remaining professional.

**Glassmorphism**: Used frosted glass effects with backdrop blur to create depth and visual hierarchy throughout the portfolio.

**Performance First**: 
- Optimized images and assets
- Lazy loading for better initial load times
- Gzip compression via nginx
- Minimal dependencies (vanilla JS, no frameworks)

**Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring the portfolio looks stunning on all devices from phones to large desktop screens.

### Development Process

1. **Planning**: Analyzed my professional background and identified key achievements to highlight
2. **Design**: Created a modern, premium design system with custom CSS variables for consistency
3. **Development**: Built semantic HTML structure with accessibility in mind
4. **Interactivity**: Added smooth animations, typing effects, and scroll-based interactions
5. **Containerization**: Dockerized the application with nginx for optimal performance
6. **Deployment**: Deployed to Google Cloud Run with required challenge labels

### Google AI Tools Used

**Google Antigravity**: I leveraged Google's Antigravity AI assistant throughout the development process:
- Rapid prototyping of HTML structure
- CSS design system creation
- JavaScript interactivity implementation
- Docker configuration optimization
- Deployment automation

Antigravity significantly accelerated my development workflow, allowing me to focus on design decisions and content while it handled the implementation details efficiently.
